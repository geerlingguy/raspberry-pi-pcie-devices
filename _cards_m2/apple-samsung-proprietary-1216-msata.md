You'll have to buy [another adapter](https://www.centralcomputer.com/m-2-pci-e-to-pci-e-3-0-x4-adaptersupport-m-key-pcie-ssd.html) and saw the PCI-e slot on the Raspberry Pi carrier board. Please follow the advice on the github issue to avoid messing up the slot!

Worth it if you have a Apple Samsung SSD laying around but you don't know what to do with it.
