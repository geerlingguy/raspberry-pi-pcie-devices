I just bought this card and am currently testing it.

It seems like the Google Coral Drivers are currently not working on the Pi OS, either 32-bit or 64-bit. In my testing, after installing the drivers, the entire Pi locks up.

Google employees have mentioned they plan on trying to get it working, but there is no specific timeline.

The [USB TPU version](https://amzn.to/3qGR2sE) does work with the Pi already, but with slightly higher latencies due to the overhead of the USB connection.

Please follow the GitHub issue for more details.
