I received a [KIOXIA BG4 M.2 NVMe SSD](https://business.kioxia.com/en-emea/ssd/client-ssd/bg4.html) drive for testing with the Pi.

I should note this drive is typically used as an OEM part, and is not commonly found in retail sales channels, like Amazon here in the US. But you can find them used pretty easily.
