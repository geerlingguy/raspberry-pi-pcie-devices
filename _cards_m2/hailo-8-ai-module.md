The Hailo-8 is an AI accelerator module that is keyed for multiple M.2 pinouts, including M, B+M, and A+E, in sizes ranging from 2230 to 2242, and you can get a model with breakable extensions out to 60 and 80mm deep.

It uses PCIe Gen 3 x2 or x4, and boasts 26 TOPS performance. It's compatible with TensorFLow, TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, Keras, Pytorch, and it should work with Compute Module 4 and Pi 5, though testing will be documented in the linked GitHub issue.
