For my [Radxa Taco NAS build video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_px298IF2k), I tested a [Sabrent Rocket Q 8TB NVMe SSD](https://amzn.to/3cnfpWQ), and it worked a treat.

Through the Pi's anemic bus, I could only get up to 412 MB/sec read speeds, and around 380 MB/sec writes, for large block sizes. See the Taco testing thread for more stats: [#268 (comment)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/268#issuecomment-965750980)
