The Raspberry Pi 5 power requirements are 5V 5A PDO, which common PD power sources cannot satisfy. 

This PD HAT from 52pi has a built-in DC-DC converter, supporting a wide voltage input of 9-24V or a PD power input of 9-20V. It outputs a maximum power of 5V 8A and supports the 5V 5A PDO of the Raspberry Pi 5. It seems that there's no need to purchase a dedicated power adapter for the Pi 5 separately.
