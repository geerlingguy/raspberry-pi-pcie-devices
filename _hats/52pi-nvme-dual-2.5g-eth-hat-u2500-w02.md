This HAT supports 2230 and 2242-size M-key NVMe SSDs. It occupies both  Raspberry Pi 5's USB3 ports, each one connecting to a 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port using Realtek 8156 USB to 2.5G Ethernet chip. The full GPIO header can extended by the HAT.

- **PCIe Interface Support** It includes a single PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) interface that can be used to expand the system with an M.2 NVMe SSD. This allows for high-speed storage solutions that are compatible with the 2230 and 2242 form factors.

- **M.2 NVMe SSD Support** The HAT board supports M.2 NVMe Solid State Drives

- **USB to Ethernet Conversion** It cleverly utilizes two USB 3.0 ports, converting them into two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces. This provides the Raspberry Pi with additional network connectivity options.
