Geekworm's [X1004](https://geekworm.com/products/x1004) holds up to two 2280-size M.2 NVMe SSDs. It uses an ASM1182e PCIe Gen 2 switch to split the Pi's single Gen 2 lane into two separate slots.

The board is pictured with a simple FFC cable which could lead to link issues with some drives, but may work okay at Gen 2 speeds.
