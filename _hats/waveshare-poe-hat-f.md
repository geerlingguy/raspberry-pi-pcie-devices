The Waveshare PoE HAT (F) for Raspberry Pi 5 is a $30 PoE HAT that should power the Raspberry Pi 5 off any PoE or PoE+ network switch/adapter.

It comes with a thin heatsink and three thermal pads, and that heatsink snaps into place using the same mounting holes the Raspberry Pi Active Cooler uses.

While this is not strictly a PCIe HAT, it does have cutouts for both PCIe port access and CSI/DSI connections, which is nice. Plus, I've tested it with Pimoroni's NVMe BASE and found no problems booting off a Kioxia XG6 NVMe SSD. See: [Pi 5 HAT: Pimoroni NVMe Base](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/565).
