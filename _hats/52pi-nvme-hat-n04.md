This M.2 NVMe HAT supports 2230, 2242, 2260, or 2280-size M-key NVMe SSDs, and has slots cut out for easier access to the GPIO pins and CSI/DSI cables. There are also ventilation holes under the drive and to its side for better airflow when used with the Active Cooler or other fans or heatsinks.

It fits an entire 2280-size NVMe SSD within the footprint of the Pi 5 by mounting the slot hardware directly on the edge of the PCB.
