This HAT supports 2230 and 2242-size M-key NVMe SSDs, and has slots cut out for easier access to the GPIO pins and CSI/DSI cables. There are also ventilation holes under the drive for better airflow when used with the Active Cooler or other fans or heatsinks.

It is also a high-quality S/PDIF output for the Raspberry Pi. It uses the I2S sound port that connects directly to the CPU without the need for an additional USB conversion. It supports sample rates up to 192kHz/24bit.
