52Pi has been working on a PCIe x1 slot (open-ended) HAT board for the Pi 5, which would allow installing practically any PCIe device directly on top of the Pi 5.

An external power plug is provided to power cards which could take up to 75W of PCIe power, and there is a switch so you can choose to either use external power or 5W power directly off the Pi's PCIe header.
