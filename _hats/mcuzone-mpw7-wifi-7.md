This board includes an M.2 E-key slot on top, suitable for WiFi 5/6/7 cards, and you can order it with or without external SMA antenna connectors.

For WiFi 7, you would need to buy an appropriate WiFi 7 adapter... which I haven't really seen any yet (much less one that has drivers you could get running on a Pi). But WiFi 6E is definitely possible today, as well as some expensive 5G chips.
