Pineberry Pi's Hat AI! is designed for 2230-size E-key M.2 PCIe devices, like Coral TPUs or WiFi cards.

It does not supply pass-through 12V power or USB 3.0, so it is mostly suited for pure PCIe devices, and not other E-key devices like many 4G or 5G modems, or other PCIe adapters which require more power than the 5W the Pi can supply through it's built-in PCIe header.
