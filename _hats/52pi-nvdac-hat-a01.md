This HAT supports 2230 and 2242-size M-key NVMe SSDs, and has slots cut out for easier access to the GPIO pins and CSI/DSI cables. There are also ventilation holes under the drive for better airflow when used with the Active Cooler or other fans or heatsinks.

It also offers the PCM5122 DAC. Equipped with a 192kHz/24bit Burr-Brown digital-to-analog converter it offers high-end sound quality.
