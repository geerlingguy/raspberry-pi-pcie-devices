It adapts one x1 PCIe port to 4 x16 slots, with an independent molex 4-pin power supply for each port.

It has the ASM1184e switch chip on it, which seems like a safe bet in terms of most card functionalityâ€”though there are a number of cards which seem to have issues on Pi OS through any kind of switch.

Anyways, I have plans... want to test a variety of setups with this, along with the new much smaller 230W PC power supply I bought so I don't have to lug the 700W Redragon around :D
