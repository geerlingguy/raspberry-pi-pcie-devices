The [MikroTik RouterBOARD 14eU](https://mikrotik.com/product/RB14eU#fndtn-downloads) RouterBOARD 14eU is an adapter card for using four miniPCIe wireless cards and 3G miniPCIe cards in a PC with a PCIe slot. This gives you the ability to use our new R11e wireless interfaces in conventional PC computers.

SIM card slots are provided for all four interfaces, as well as USB ports to ensure USB connectivity to the host PC, which is required for 3G miniPCIe cards.

Comes with both low and regular profile brackets. Brackets include holes for mounting SMA connectors, or for using as cable exit holes.
