Branded under many different names, this is a generic USB 3.0 expansion card with four USB 3.0 ports, and the Renesas uPD720201 USB 3.0 controller.

This particular board requires an extensive flashing process to make it work correctly with the Linux drivers included in Raspberry Pi OS, and that process is [outlined in this comment](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/103#issuecomment-804034815), thanks to [@rtreffer](https://github.com/rtreffer).

Other cards using the same chipset may not require the same re-flashing process, though.
