The Argon ONE UP is going to be [launched on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/argonforty/upton-one-the-true-raspberry-pi-compute-module-5-laptop) (with all the caveats that apply there...).

The unit includes:

  - CM5 8 GB WiFi
  - 256 GB NVMe SSD
  - 14" IPS 16:10 display (1920x1200)
  - 1080p front camera
  - Stereo speakers

Among other features. Raspberry Pi OS is not built with mobility in mind, so there may be some growing pains. Check the GitHub issue for more experience notes.
