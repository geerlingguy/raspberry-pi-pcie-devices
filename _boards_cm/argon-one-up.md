The Argon ONE UP [launched on Kickstarter in 2025](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/argonforty/upton-one-the-true-raspberry-pi-compute-module-5-laptop), and was shipped to backers in early 2026.

They sell a full version with:

  - CM5 8 GB WiFi
  - 256 GB NVMe SSD
  - 14" IPS 16:10 display (1920x1200)
  - 1080p front camera
  - Stereo speakers

Or a 'Shell' version without the CM5 and SSD.

Among other features. Raspberry Pi OS is not built with mobility in mind, so there are growing pains. Check the GitHub issue for notes from the community about using this laptop.
