The [Upberry](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQga-_YL5OL/) is a tiny CM4 carrier with only HDMI, USB-C for power and OTG support, and status and activity LEDs. There will be a machined aluminum case that keeps with the trim aesthetic, and it should be able to fit in as a tiny display computer, or something like a [Chromecast](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast?hl=en-US), if you have a WiFi version of the CM4.
