This CM4 Handheld is based on the now-discontinued [Pocket C.H.I.P.](https://shop.pocketchip.co/collections/frontpage/products/pocket-c-h-i-p-new), and allows for handheld use and retro gaming on its built-in touchscreen display. It includes a full keypad below the display, all built on top of a nice looking PCB!
