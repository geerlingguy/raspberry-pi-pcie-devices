The [LSI 9405W-16i HBA](https://amzn.to/3srcZOh) (now known as the Broadcom HBA 9405W-16i Tri-Mode Storage Adapter) Should be similar to the [9460-16i](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/72), and should hopefully be supported on ARM (to some extent) unlike older cards like the 9305-16i (see [Issue #195](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/195)).

You can read more about using the card [in the issue here](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/196).
