The Holybro Pixhawk CM4 Baseboard is a carrier board for both a [PixHawk](https://pixhawk.org/) 5X or 6X flight controller module and a Raspberry Pi CM4.  It is compatible with [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) and [PX4](https://px4.io/) autopilot software and the flight controller can communicate directly with software on the Pi.
