@will127534 is back with the [CM4 Pi 4 Cluster HAT], which is by far the most compact and powerful Pi cluster on the planetâ€”it packs four Compute Module 4s onto a HAT the size of a Pi 4 model B and even throws in a Raspberry Pi Pico for management tasks! It has a built-in Gigabit network switch to provide networking to all the CM4s.
