The [CM4 Cluster Mini-ITX](https://dwmzone.com/en/raspberry-pi/1045-raspberry-pi-cm4-cluster-mini-itx-board-6-rpi-cm4-supported.html) is a standard size mini-ITX board that supports up to 6 CM4 modules, with an M.2 slot and microSD card slot available to each of the boards. It uses a 4-pin ATX CPU power plug, and has two RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet ports connected through an onboard switch. It looks like there is a USB 2.0 hub and two HDMI ports connected through to the first Pi, which is nice for cluster management / debugging purposes.
