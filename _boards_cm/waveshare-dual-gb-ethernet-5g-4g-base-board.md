Waveshare has a new [Dual Gigabit Ethernet 5G/4G Base Board](https://www.waveshare.com/cm4-dual-eth-4g-5g-base.htm) with dual gigabit Ethernet (2nd port is USB RTL8153 chip), RTC, dual HDMI, USB 3.2 Gen 1, and an M.2 B-key slot.

The board seems ideal for use as a router with something like OpenWRT, with a WAN connection and 4G/5G failover/backup.
