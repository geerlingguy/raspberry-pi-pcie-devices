The RPI4 Clock by Will Whang ([@will127534](https://github.com/will127534)) uses the Symmetricom Rubidium Oscillator in a similar way to the [Time Card](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project/tree/master/Time-Card#readme).

It looks like this board basically marries the Time Card to the Pi CM4 directly, making an even more compact time server package. Still has to wait on hardware timestamping support to get it working with the CM4's NIC, though (see: [raspberrypi/linux#4151](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/4151)).
