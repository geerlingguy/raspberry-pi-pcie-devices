The [AI GATEWAY 9500-CM4](https://modberry.techbase.eu/modberry/ai-gateway-series-with-compute-module-4-and-google-coral-tpu/) marries a CM4 with a Google Coral TPU, over PCIe (interestingly... I'm guessing they haven't been able to sell this through yet due to the PCIe driver bugs everyone's been running into—see [Issue #44](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/44).
