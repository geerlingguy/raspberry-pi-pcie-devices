The [Mini SS](https://retrogamerestore.com/store/minisscm4/) supports mini HDMI and CRT (Composite and RGBS) output. There's a planned extension board that would also give 1 Gbps network and a connector for the original Sega Saturn A/V cable. The Mini SS board emulates the original console using RetroPie 4.71 or later.

It's made to fit inside the [Best HIT Chonicle 2/5 SEGASATURN case](https://amzn.to/38ve8uP), which is available for $33 on Amazon.

The board functions best with the CM4 Lite, booting directly from the SD card. You can use a regular CM4, but just know that in that case it boots from the internal eMMC first.
