The [Ochin Tiny Carrier Board for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Ochin-Tiny-Carrier-Board-for-Raspberry-Pi-Compute-Module-4-p-5463.html) is a very compact CM4-sized carrier board that exposes a number of interfaces on the topside, including CSI/DSI, USB 2.0, USART, UART, I2C, and SPI. The board is built for robotics and includes a DC-DC regulator for up to 7 amps, GHS connectors, and a current limiting switch.
