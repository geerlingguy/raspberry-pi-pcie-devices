The T1-T0ast is a Mini ITX CM5 carrier board that's meant to allow "legacy Sata, PCIE, and ATX/ITX equipment to find a useful home."

The motherboard uses standard ATX 24 pin power, supplies power to two HDDs using 4-pin Molex connectors, and can interface with two SATA drives using ports directly on the board. There's also a full x16 (x1 electrical) PCIe slot, and an M.2 NVMe SSD slot.
