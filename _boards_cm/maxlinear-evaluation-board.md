From MaxLinear's [documentation](https://assets.maxlinear.com/web/documents/xr17v358.pdf):

The [XR17V358](https://www.maxlinear.com/product/interface/uarts/pcie-uarts/xr17v358) is a single chip 8-channel PCI Express UART, optimized for higher performance and lower power. The  XR17V358 serves as a single lane PCIe bridge to 8 independent enhanced 16550 compatible UARTs.  The XR17V358 is compliant to PCIe 2.0 Gen 1 (2.5 GT/s). In addition to the UART channels, the XR17V358 has 16  multi-purpose  I/Os  (MPIOs),  a  16-bit  general purpose  counter/timer  and  a  global  interrupt  status register to optimize interrupt servicing.
