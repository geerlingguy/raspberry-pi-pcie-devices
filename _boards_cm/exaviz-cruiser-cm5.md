Exavis' Cruiser board blends 2x SATA ports, SATA power, a PoE-enabled switch, 2.5 Gbps Ethernet, an ESP32, and M.2 NVMe support to a Compute Module 5.

It is geared towards DVR and network storage applications (e.g. NAS builds), and both DeskPi and Exaviz are working on rackmount cases for both mini (10") and full-size racks.

See the GitHub issue for architecture and usage notes.
