The Xerxes Pi is a Compute Module blade designed for 1U racks designed by Rapid Analysis.

It was launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1907647187/small-board-big-possibilities-xerxes-pi), and is estimated to ship in late 2025. The board includes:

- USB-C on-the-go port for power and data
- 1 Gbps Ethernet jack
- M.2 M-key (up to 2280 size)
- microSD card slot on the bottom
- I2C qwiic connector
- SH-04 PWM Fan connector
- JTAG UART Debug connector

Optional PoE support can be added using an optional daughterboard.

Racks for the Xerxes Pi are open source and can be found on Printables here: https://www.printables.com/@Rapid_3032975
