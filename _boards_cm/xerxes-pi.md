The Xerxes Pi is a Compute Module blade designed for 1U racks designed by Rapid Analysis.

It was launched on Kickstarter, and is estimated to ship in late 2025. The board includes USB-C power input, a micro USB port, and a 1 Gbps Ethernet jack. Optional PoE support can be added, and there's an M.2 E-key (up to 2260 size) and microSD card slot on the bottom.
