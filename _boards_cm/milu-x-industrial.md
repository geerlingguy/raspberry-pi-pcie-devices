The Milü-X Industrial IoT Gateway System is an IECEx-certified edge industrial computer powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. Its specs include an explosion-proof enclosure with isolated Ethernet, wireless, and power cable glands, two M.2 NVMe slots for redundant storage, two M.2 slots for WiFi and 4G or 5G wireless, a high-temp RTC battery, and a massive heatsink attached to the Pi for high temperature use.
