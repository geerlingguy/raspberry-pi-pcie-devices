This is the world's first 3D-Printer Control Unit based on the all new Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module.

The first member of the Sigmoid Series of 3D printer control units, the Sigmoid S7P, connects the two baselines of 3D printing control systems. A realtime capable low-level system for motion control and a high-level OS based system for management and HMI. Just like it's mathematical counterpart.
