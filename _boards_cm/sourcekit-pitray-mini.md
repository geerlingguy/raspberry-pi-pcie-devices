The Sourcekit PiTray mini is a companion IO board for Raspberry Pi Compute Module (not included). It is designed for use both as a development system for Compute Module 4 and as an embedded board integrated into end products.

It provides an excellent way to bring similar development experience of Raspberry Pi 4B to Compute Module 4. So users could upgrade their system or setup from the standard Raspberry Pi 4B to CM4 seamlessly. With capability to flash OS image to eMMC on CM4, PiTray mini serves as a budget alternative to Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board.
