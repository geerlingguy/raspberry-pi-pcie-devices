Ledato's PiCam Module for the CM4 is a simple and ultra-compact board to mount a Raspberry Pi Camera and Compute Module 4 in a very tiny form factor, even smaller than that of the CM4Ext Nano that I've previously tested. The default setup includes wifi-connect, motioneye, and tensorflow, so you can stream a feed with object detection out to other computers on the network!
