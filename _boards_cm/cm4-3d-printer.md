The Compute Module 4 Powered 3D Printer Board, created by Clem ([@MAYERMAKES](https://twitter.com/MAYERMAKES) from _Element14 Presents_, includes Trinamic Stepper drivers, an ESP32-S2, an ATMega2560-16AU, and many other components. The board allows you to use a CM4 to control the 3D printer's motors, rather than using a computer.
