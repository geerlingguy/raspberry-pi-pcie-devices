The [ATX Watchdog for CM4](https://www.tindie.com/products/tomtibbetts/atx-watchdog-for-compute-module-4/) is an ATX power supply that stacks on the IO Board's HAT connection and provides 12V/3A power to the CM4 via the 4-pin berg/floppy power connector, plus 12/5VDC (3A... at what voltage?) screw terminals to power other project circuits in addition to the Pi. It also includes a watchdog timer, safe shutdown capability, and a lighted power button.
