Mirko's [PicoBerry](https://hackaday.io/project/182747-picoberry-tiny-cm4-carrier-board) is a tiny CM4 carrier board with USB-C power input, some status LEDs, and a full 40-pin GPIO header. It's only usable with eMMC compute modules, but makes for a tidy little carrier if you just need to work with WiFi + GPIO in your project.
