The HomePiNAS board is an expansion board for the Raspberry Pi CM5 that turns it into a proper NAS/server platform with low power consumption, and support for up to 6 SATA drives and two M.2 NVMe SSDs through a PCIe Gen 3 switch.

It may be released commercially in the future, and there are STEP files for a 3D printable 6-bay NAS enclosure with removable drive sleds. It may be available through CrowdSupply and later, if successful, may be available for purchase from Tindie or elsewhere.

For more information and 3D files, check out the GitHub repository: [kelroy1990/Homelabs-Pi-Storage](https://github.com/kelroy1990/Homelabs-Pi-Storage).
