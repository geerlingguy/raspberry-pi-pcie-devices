The [Secure Edge Node - D35](https://store.zymbit.com/products/secure-compute-node-d35) is an extremely secure computing platform built around the Compute Module 4:

The 3.5" hard drive-sized enclosure houses multiple physical security implementations like pressure-sensitive tamper switches, temperature and accelerometer sensors, and more. The included [Secure Compute Module](https://store.zymbit.com/products/secure-compute-module-scm4) is a security-hardened Raspberry Pi CM4 with hardware baked on the backside to verify boot, add hardware cryptography and secure wallet storage, and more.

It can be powered via SATA power, PoE, or even a 12v barrel plug.
