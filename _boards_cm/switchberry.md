The Switchberry is a 1 Gbps PTP switch built by the Time Appliances Project.

> The PCB integrates a managed 7-port Gigabit Ethernet switch, exposing various interfaces and peripherals for a versatile and cost-effective 1G network switch with Precision Time Protocol (PTP) capabilities.

At its heart is a [Microchip KSZ9567STXI](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ksz9567) 7-port Gigabit Ethernet switch with IEEE 1588, SGMII/RGMII/MII/RMII.
