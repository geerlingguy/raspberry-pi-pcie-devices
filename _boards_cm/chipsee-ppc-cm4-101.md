The [Chipsee 10.1" Industrial Panel PC](https://chipsee.com/product/ppc-cm4-101/) (model PPC-CM4-101) is a 10.1" touchscreen powered by a Raspberry Pi.

It has opto-isolated digital inputs and outputs, multiple serial connections (including RS485), optional internal expansion for ZigBee or 4G via mini PCIe. There are two antenna jacks on the back for 4G and WiFi/Bluetooth, and the screen assembly—when properly installed—has a rubber gasket that provides IP65 dust and moisture protection.
