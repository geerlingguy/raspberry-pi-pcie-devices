The [AIO-CM4-156](https://chipsee.com/product/aio-cm4-156/) is an all-in-one desktop computer based on Raspberry Pi CM4. It includes two USB 3.0 ports, a full-size HDMI port (so you can have a 2nd external display), 1 Gbps Ethernet, a microSD card slot, 3.5mm audio output, and a full 40 pin GPIO port. Internally, there's also an NVMe SSD M.2 slot (SSD optional). The screen can be made to be a touchscreen, optionally, and the enclosure includes built-in speakers.
