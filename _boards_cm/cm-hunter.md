The CM Hunter is an open source hardware carrier board with ISO interfaces. It includes three galvanically-isolated interfaces:

  - RS485/Modbus
  - 1-Wire
  - CAN 2.0B

As well as many of the standard Compute Module interfaces like HDMI, Ethernet, and USB 2.0. It also includes an RTC, relay, LCD touchscreen display interface, and cooling fan.

The board should launch on Kickstarter 'soon' (as of March 17, 2021).
