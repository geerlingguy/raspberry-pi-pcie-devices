The [Utility Control Unit](https://hackaday.io/project/181244-utility-control-unit) is a DIN-rail mountable 3D-printer/smart home server, developed by @bauke2012 and @H3ndrik-Jan.

The system consists of two PCB's stacked on top of each other, fitted into a small (6 DIN-modules wide) enclosure. The unit has a beefy power supply (12V input), USB 3.0 host controller, outputs for controlling relays, RS485 connection, can read out a current transformer, control LED-strips including WS2812B's, inputs for buttons, and has all fast IO of the CM4 (like gigabit ethernet, HDMI) accessible on the front.
