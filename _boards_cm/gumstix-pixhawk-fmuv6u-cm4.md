The Gumstix Raspberry Pi CM4 + [PixHawk](https://pixhawk.org/) FMUv6U brings together 3 powerful compute devices. With the Raspberry Pi CM4 module, [Coral EdgeTPU](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator-module), and the ST Micro STM32H7 MCU, along with support hardware for MAVs, rovers and other robotics platforms, designing TensorFlow-assisted autonomous vehicles has never been so accessible.
