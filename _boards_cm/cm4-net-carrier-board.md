The [CM4 Net Carrier Board](https://github.com/jkiv/cm4-carriers) is a carrier board that supplies power to the Pi and exposes its built-in NIC through an Ethernet port. Nice and simple. It looks like it also allows switching modes for the USB-C connector so it can provide power or allow use as USB OTG for flashing eMMC Compute Modules.
