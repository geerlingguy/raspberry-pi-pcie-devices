Looks to have a 2nd Gigabit Ethernet port off an internal USB 3.0 bus (with a Realtek chip for the NIC), similar to the USB 3.0-based approach [Seeed used on their board](https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/boards_cm/seeed-dual-gig-cm4-routerboard.html). Biggest question is if it can perform well on that 2nd interface. It does have a lot more IO than the other boards, so that could make it a nice platform for DIY routers.
