This IO Board for the Compute Module 4 has a second Gigabit Ethernet port off an internal USB 3.0 bus, using a Realtek chip for the NIC. This is similar to the USB 3.0-based approach [Seeed used on their board](https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/boards_cm/seeed-dual-gig-cm4-routerboard.html). With it's wide array of IO, it could make a nice platform for DIY routers.
