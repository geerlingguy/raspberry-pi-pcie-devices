This board integrates an 802.3af-compliant PoE circuit (5V/2.5A) for powering the board over Ethernet, and includes 4x USB 3.2 Gen1 ports instead of the 2x USB 2.0 ports on the official Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO board.

It also has a 5V/12V combo fan header, a colored GPIO header, and allows power input between 7V-36V
