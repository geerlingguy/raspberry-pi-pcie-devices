The Radxa Taco is the ultimate CM4 carrier board designed for NAS/server/router applications. The idea is based on the Quad SATA HAT for the Raspberry Pi 4 and goes much further. The Radxa Taco has the following features:

  - ASM1806 PCIe switch
  - Dual ethernet, one 1G from CM4, one 2.5G from Realtek 8125b
  - 5x SATA via JMB585
  - 1x M.2 M key NVMe
  - 1x M.2 E key for WiFi or TPU
  - 10P header for Top Board with OLED and button
  - RTC/USB 2/uSD card

The bare board should be available for purchase in early 2022, and a kit with a case, board, and compute module should be available soon after.
