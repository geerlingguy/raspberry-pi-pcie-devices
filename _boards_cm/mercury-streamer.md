The Mercury Streamer (formerly known as 'CM4AES') is built by Pi 2 Design, who has a history of making high-quality audio output devices for the Raspberry Pi.

It includes multiple high-quality audio outputs, including S/PDIF, AES (coaxial), Optical audio (TOSlink), an AES balanced XLR jack, and an I2S HDMI output. It is designed for maximum audio fidelity, with a high quality power circuit.

It also includes an M-key M.2 slot, which allows for fast NVMe storage, and has other common ports like HDMI and Ethernet, and a single USB 2.0 port.
