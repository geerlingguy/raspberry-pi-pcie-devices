A project from @tlalexander, the [Dual CM4 Gigabit Switch Board](https://github.com/tlalexander/rpi-cm4-switch-board) is a CM4 carrier board with integrated gigabit switch. It has three RJ45 jacks, each connected to a Microchip KSZ9567. This is a prelude to @tlalexander's eventual plan to design a version of the board with four CM4s and one ethernet jack, all passed through the gig switch.
