The CurryPi CM4 Cluster board was hinted at in @aep's [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/arvidep/status/1445363759313297412). It's a 4-node CM4 cluster board. It looks like each Pi gets an M.2 NVMe slot, and each node gets its own network jack on the rear. Looking at the project's GitHub repository, it seems like there is some active development and improvements to the board's power management are underway.
