The [Exo Sense Pi](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/exo-sense-pi/) is a multi-sensor package powered by a Compute Module 4.

It includes sensors for temperature, humidity, air quality (VOC), light intensity, sound intensity (microphone, can also be used for recording), and a PIR motion sensor. It also includes an RS-485 bus and digital inputs and outputs. There's also an RTC and buzzer, plus a GPIO controlled LED and Microchip ATECC608A secure element chip.

They can also build in an earthquake sensor module.

See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/444) for more information and updates.
