The Homelabs Pi Storage board is an expansion board for the Raspberry Pi CM5 that turns it into a proper NAS/server platform with low power consumption, and support for up to 6 SATA drives and two M.2 NVMe SSDs through a PCIe Gen 3 switch.

It may be released commercially in the future, and there are STEP files for a 3D printable 6-bay NAS enclosure with removable drive sleds. It may be available through Crowd Supply and later, if successful, may be available for purchase from Tindie or elsewhere.
