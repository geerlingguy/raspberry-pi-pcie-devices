This board combines a Coral Edge TPU with a Raspberry Pi CM4 to process two camera streams from imx219 camera sensors.

The project is listed as coming soon to Kickstarter, and has been demonstrated as identifying objects in a robot's field of view in real-time with excellent accuracy, operating at 4 TOPS.
