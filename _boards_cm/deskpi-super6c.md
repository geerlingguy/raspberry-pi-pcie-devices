The [DeskPi Super6C](https://deskpi.com/collections/deskpi-super6c/products/deskpi-super6c-raspberry-pi-cm4-cluster-mini-itx-board-6-rpi-cm4-supported) is a standard size mini-ITX board that supports up to 6 CM4 modules, with an M.2 slot and microSD card slot available to each of the boards. It uses a 4-pin ATX CPU power plug, and has two RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet ports connected through an onboard 8-port Gigabit switch.

There's a USB 2.0 hub and two HDMI ports connected to the first Pi, which is nice for cluster management / debugging purposes.

You can buy the board from [DeskPi](https://deskpi.com/collections/deskpi-super6c/products/deskpi-super6c-raspberry-pi-cm4-cluster-mini-itx-board-6-rpi-cm4-supported) and [DWMZone](https://dwmzone.com/en/raspberry-pi/1045-raspberry-pi-cm4-cluster-mini-itx-board-6-rpi-cm4-supported.html).

See the DeskPi Team's technical documentation of the board in their [super6c repo](https://github.com/DeskPi-Team/super6c).
