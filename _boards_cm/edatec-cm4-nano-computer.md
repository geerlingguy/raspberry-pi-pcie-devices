The [EDATEC CM4 Nano](https://www.edatec.cn/en/Product/Embedded_Computers/2019/0826/74.html) is an Industrial Computer based on Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, which provides full 40pins expansion capability like standard Raspberry Pi 4, but specially consider about the requirement of system reliability, the system can work at -25°~60° reliably thanks to aluminum heatsink at the bottom case. When OS is stored on eMMC, the user data can be stored on SD card which provides both low cost and reliable storage solution.
