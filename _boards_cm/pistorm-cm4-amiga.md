The [PiStorm32](https://twitter.com/Claude1079/status/1435253852064952326) from [Claude Scwarz](https://mobile.twitter.com/Claude1079) is a 32bit Open Source accelerator card for Commodore Amiga computers, using the CM4 for Motorola 68000 CPU emulation, NVMe drive, graphics card available from AmigaOS among more things. It is however closed source until it has been brought up and is fully working, so no one tries to sell expensive paper weights based on a bad revision of the board.

Project GitHub [here](https://github.com/captain-amygdala/pistorm).

The board is not released yet, and doesn't have full CM4 functionality yet either, but Claude has been taking steps towards that end and you can see some of it on his Twitter [here](https://mobile.twitter.com/Claude1079/status/1383669659648495625).
