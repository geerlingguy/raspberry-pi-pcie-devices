          <h3>Description and Notes</h3>
          <p>Sangoma is the market leader in supporting reliable SD-WAN failover solutions for large retail organizations over a T1 / E1 internet connection. Sangoma’s world-class A-series T1 / E1 data cards have been dominating the market sector since 1984, being installed into appliances of large vendors and OEMs, supporting some of the largest Point-of-Sale (POS) T1 WAN failover solutions and data applications.</p>

<p>Sangoma’s <a href="https://www.sangoma.com/telephony-cards/sd-wan/">SD-WAN failover and data cards</a> support transfer rates from 1.544 Mbps to 32,800 Mbps of full duplex data. Our cards are powered  by a powerful driver and API suite providing support for WAN protocols such as CHDLC, Frame Relay, X.25, ATM, PPP, HDLC and MULTILINK.</p>

<p>Choose from 1 port of T1/E1 up to 16 ports all using only one (1) PCI or PCI Express slot.  They are 2U form factors and compatible in virtually all commercial grade hardware and Linux operating systems.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>This driver only supports 32-bit kernels, and needs the following added to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">boot/config.txt</code> in order to support 32-bit DMA:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Force PCIe config to support 32bit DMA addresses at the expense of
# having to bounce buffers.
dtoverlay=pcie-32bit-dma
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Kernel drivers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hharte/wanpipe-rpi-cm4">Patched driver</a> with changes to support support the Raspberry Pi CM4 (32-bit kernel only.)</li>
  <li>Original <a href="https://wiki.freepbx.org/display/DAS/Telephony+Card+Driver+Download">Wanpipe</a> driver from Sangoma.</li>
</ul>

<p>To compile, run “./Setup dahdi –silent”</p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>Currently working with <a href="https://github.com/hharte/wanpipe-rpi-cm4">patched driver</a> on 32-bit kernels only.</p>

<p>Support for 64-bit kernels is unlikely as the driver makes extensive use of non-64-bit aligned bitops functions, which are not supported on ARM processors, and lead to an alignment trap.</p>
