Similar to the ASRock Rack M2_VGA, this Mini PCIe board uses the SM750 to power multi-display graphics with a fairly limited GPU. But support for the chip is built into the kernel, via an experimental driver.

Over in [this issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/62#issuecomment-1046319009), @TobleMiner got the card to at least work with a framebuffer console on the CM4.

See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/398) for more details and future updates.
