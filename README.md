[**Raspberry Pi PCIe Devices**](https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/) is a compatibility database that tracks which devices are and are not compatible with the [Raspberry Pi CM4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/).

## üîß Setup and installation

To run a copy of this website in a local web development environment, you need to have **Jekyll**, **GitHub CLI** *OR* **GitHub Desktop**, and a local clone of the website's repository.

### Jekyll
This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) gem.

**To install Jekyll:**
1. Visit Jekyll's [installation page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) in your browser
2. Click the guide for your operating system (macOS, Ubuntu, Other Linux, or Windows)
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to install Jekyll.

### GitHub
There are two ways to use GitHub locally:
* via [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), using the command line
* via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), an app available for macOS and Windows

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

Once you have Jekyll running and the [raspberry-pi-pcie-devices repository](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices) cloned, you can build and run the site locally.

### Build the site locally
1. In the command line, `cd` into the `raspberry-pi-pcie-devices` folder that contains the cloned repository.
2. To build the site, run `jekyll serve`.
3. You should now be able to access the local site at http://localhost:4000 in your web browser of choice.

As long as `jekyll serve` is running, you'll be able to watch the site and all changes you make to it in real time.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

### Ways to contribute
* **Add a card or board to the list:** Use issues and pull requests to add new board entries and card entries to the site.
* **Test a card yourself:** If you want to test a card on your own, I'm happy to add it to the database, provided you give all the testing details, information like `lspci` and `dmesg` logs, etc. in a GitHub issue, and follow the project's conventions for card details.
* **Fix problems with the repository:** If you find any typos, incorrect links or images, or other issues in this repository, please submit a pull request to fix the problem or [open a new issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/new/choose) to point the problem out for someone else to fix.
* **Mail me a card or board:** I accept cards and boards mailed to me, and can occasionally pay shipping as well. I credit senders in all videos/posts that result from donated card testing!
