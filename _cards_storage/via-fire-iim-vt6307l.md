GitHub user @WACOMalt was able to get a Generic VT6307L / ASM1083 2+1 IEEE 1394 Firewire PCIe card working on the Compute Module 4.

He compiled the kernel with `firewire-ohci` enabled, and added `dtoverlay=pcie-32bit-dma` to `/boot/config.txt`, and was able to get DVGrab to capture footage live and from tapes.

He did report trouble initializing the camera shortly after boot, and said his only concern was reliabilityâ€”there were a few dropped frames or failed initializations.

See the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/443) for more information and updates.
