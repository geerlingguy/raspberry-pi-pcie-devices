Alftel just shipped me a Seaberry board to test, and it came with a few PCI Express devices pre-installed.

One such device is the [IOCrest mini PCIe dual SATA card](http://www.iocrest.com/index.php?id=2233), which has an ASM1061 chip on it.

Hopefully it should just work 'out of the box' with the CM4 and a relatively recent version of Pi OS.
