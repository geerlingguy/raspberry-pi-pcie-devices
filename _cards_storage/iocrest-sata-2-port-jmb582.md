Since mid-2021, [SATA support is built into the Raspberry Pi kernel](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/raspberry-pi-os-now-has-sata-support-built), so assuming you have updated to the latest version (`sudo apt upgrade -y`), this card _should_ work out of the box.

See the linked GitHub issue for current status testing this card on various Raspberry Pis.
