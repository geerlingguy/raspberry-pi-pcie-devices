The [9440-8i](https://www.broadcom.com/products/storage/raid-controllers/megaraid-9440-8i) should potentially work on the Pi, since the 94xx/95xx and newer cards have drivers that support ARM.

You can follow @wallentx's testing progress with it over on the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/250).
