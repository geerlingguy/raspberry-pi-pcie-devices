In tandem with my work on the Time Card (see [#199](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/199)), I noticed [@lasselj](https://github.com/lasselj) had tested the [Intel I210](https://amzn.to/3jscEb4) on a Raspberry Pi and it seems to be working.

I may try picking one of these up to see if I can get it working with the Time Card.

For more discussion of this card and its driver, see [this thread about IEEE1588-2008 support in the Pi Linux issues](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/4151).
