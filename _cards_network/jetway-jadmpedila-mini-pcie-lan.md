Alftel just shipped me a Seaberry board to test, and it came with a few PCI Express devices pre-installed.

One such device is a [Jetway JADMPEIDLA dual-gigabit Intel i350 Mini PCIe LAN card](https://www.jetwaycomputer.com/spec/expansion/ADMPEIDLA.pdf), which has an Intel NHI350AM2 chip on it.

Will probably need Intel drivers installed to work.
