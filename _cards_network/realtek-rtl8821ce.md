I pulled an [915620-001 Wireless card](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl8821ce) out of my HP Slim S01 desktop when I upgraded it to Intel's AX200 WiFi 6 card. It uses Realtek's RTL8821CE chipset, and supports 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. It only has one antenna connection.
