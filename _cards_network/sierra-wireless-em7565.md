The modem is a Cat-12 4G modem in the M.2 form factor (not like the mini PCIe modems I'm used to), and supposedly delivers up to 600 Mbps down, 150 Mbps up. It has GNSS and seems to be popular in more high-end industrial devices.

You can find more details and future updates in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/366).
